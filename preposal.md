# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to make a technical analysis backtester. The program will prompt the user to type in the ticker that they would like to test, how many years back, and the two moving averages they would like to try. When the program runs, I will use multiple turtles to make the graph, plot the stock line and the two moving averages so the user can visualize them better. The graph will also scale to the demands of the graph. After the graph is completeld, the turtle program will give the user the data. It will provide the returns that the ticker got over those years, it will provide the relevant benchmark return during that period, and then the return if you were invested when the first moving average was over the second moving average and vice versa.
