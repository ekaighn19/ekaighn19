Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

My project is basically completed. All the inputs work, the stock data imports into the program, the graphing works, I ended up using the plotly program. I also figured out how to return the returns of all necessary items that I wanted.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to make my code more readable and refine it a little more. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I really struggled with computing the return of the stock if you invested with the one moving average over the other. I ended up using the pig lab as a reference to make the code.
