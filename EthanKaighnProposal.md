# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Moving Average Trading Stock Backtester

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The program will ask you to choose a stock and two moving averages, and return the amount an investor would have made if they invested when Moving Average A is over Moving Average B

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will first prompt the user to enter the ticker of the stock they would like to analyze, the start and finish date, and two moving averages. I will use yfinance to import the finance data. Then, I will use matplotlib to plot the price of the stock along with the two moving averages in the frame. Then, I will calculate the return that the stock returned during the period, the return that the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones returned during that time. Lastly, the program will return what your returns would have been if you invested when moving average A is above moving average B and vice versa.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be if the graph with the stock price is plotted as well as the stock return over that period for the stock and the indexes works. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is if everything besides the moving average return calculation works

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is would be that everything I put in my proposal works to perfection

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to use the yfinance and matplotlib to import finance data from any stock and plot the graph. I will also need to figure out how to calculate the return that would would be attained when investing with one moving average over the other
